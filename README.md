# Calgary-Rent-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
A machine learning model that predicts average rent prices in Calgary using economic, demographic, and housing‑market indicators from 2000–2024.

# 📘 1. Introduction
Understanding how rent prices evolve is essential for renters, policymakers, developers, and analysts. Calgary’s housing market has experienced significant shifts over the past two decades, influenced by economic cycles, population growth, construction activity, and vacancy trends.
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze historical housing and economic data and predict average rent prices in Calgary. The goal is to build an interpretable, data‑driven model that captures the key factors influencing rent and provides a foundation for future predictions.

# 📊 2. Project Objectives
This project aims to:
- Build a clean, reproducible machine learning workflow for rent prediction
- Engineer meaningful features that reflect supply, demand, and economic pressure
- Compare multiple regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)
- Select the best model based on performance and interpretability
- Package the final model into a scalable pipeline
- Visualize historical vs predicted rent trends
- Extract insights about the drivers of rent changes in Calgary
